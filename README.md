## 🔐 Security & Identity

Our system is built with **end-to-end security** and **decentralized identity** to meet the standards of modern healthcare applications:

- 🔑 **JWT / OAuth2** – Secure access control and session handling  
- 🧾 **Hyperledger Fabric CA** – Issuance and verification of digital identities  
- 🔒 **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Biometrics, PINs, or secure token options  
- 📂 **Hyperledger Aries** – Off-chain decentralized identity and credential management  
- 🧠 **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)** – Privacy-preserving proofs for sensitive interactions  
- 🔄 **FHIR / HL7 APIs** – Interoperability with existing hospital systems and EHRs
